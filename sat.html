            <h4><strong>What is the SAT?</strong></h4>
            <p>The SAT is a globally recognized college admission test that lets you show colleges what you know and how well you can apply that knowledge. It tests your knowledge of reading, writing and math -- subjects that are taught every day in high school classrooms. Most students take the SAT during their junior or senior year of high school, and almost all colleges and universities use the SAT to make admission decisions.<br></p>
            <p>Taking the SAT is the first step in finding the right college for you -- the place where you can further develop your skills and pursue your passions. But SAT scores are just one of many factors that colleges consider when making their admission decisions. High school grades are also very important. In fact, the combination of high school grades and SAT scores is the best predictor of your academic success in college.</p>
            <h4> <strong>What does the SAT test?</strong></h4>
            <p>The SAT doesn&#x27;t test logic or abstract reasoning. It tests the skills you&#x27;re learning in school: reading, writing, and math. Your knowledge and skills in these subjects are important for success in college and throughout your life.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The critical reading section includes reading passages and sentence completions. </li>
              <li>The writing section includes a short essay and multiple-choice questions on identifying errors and improving grammar and usage. </li>
              <li>The mathematics section includes questions on arithmetic operations, algebra, geometry, statistics, and probability.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><strong>How can I do my best on the SAT?</strong></h4>
            <p>The best way to get ready for the SAT is to take challenging courses, study hard, and read and write in and outside of the classroom.</p>
            <p>Studies suggest that cramming and short-term prep can&#x27;t substitute for hard work in school, but it&#x27;s certainly a good idea for you to become familiar and comfortable with the test format and question types. That&#x27;s why the best SAT practice is the PSAT/NMSQT, which covers the same subjects under timed conditions. Remember, a little practice goes a long way.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <h4><strong>Is the SAT the most important factor in college admission?</strong></h4>
            <p>The SAT is just one factor among many that colleges use to get to know you better. It&#x27;s best to keep the test in perspective and understand that it&#x27;s only part of a comprehensive admission process that also recognizes other factors, like extracurricular activities and personal recommendations.</p>
            <p>Every college and university uses a different combination of criteria for admission. Feel free to reach out to the schools you&#x27;re interested in to understand their unique admission policies.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <h4><strong>Which SAT questions make it onto the exam?</strong></h4>
            <p>Every SAT question goes through a very careful review process before making it into your exam booklet. Each question that you see has been:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reviewed by a team of experts, including math and English teachers, to make sure that it reflects what most college-bound students are learning in school. </li>
              <li>Thoroughly tested to make sure that it is fair for students of all backgrounds and ethnicities. </li>
              <li>Questions that don&#x27;t make it through these steps will never show up on an actual exam.<br></li>
            </ul>

            <p> </p>
            <h4><strong>How much does it cost to take the SAT?</strong></h4>
            <p>SAT I (also known as: SAT Reasoning)</p>
            <p>Regular registration: $47</p>
            <p>Late registration: $71</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>SAT II (also known as SAT Subject)</p>
            <p>Base fee: $21 (per test date)</p>
            <p>Language w/Listening Tests: +$21(per test)</p>

            <p>Additional fees apply if you register late or make changes to your test type, center or date after registering.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <h4><strong>What is a fee waiver?</strong></h4>
            <p>Fee waivers cover more than just the testing fees. When you register for the SAT or SAT Subject Tests, the fee waiver will cover: 1) the registration fee, 2) four additional flexible score reports, 3) Question-and-Answer Service or Student Answer Service, 4) Up to four Request for Waiver of College Application Fee Forms, 5) A $40 discount off the regular price the Official SAT Online Course, and 6) Any fees associated with registering internationally.</p>
            <p>The College Board offers assistance to students for whom payment of SAT and SAT Subject Tests fees may be a barrier to testing and applying for college.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <h4><strong>Am I eligible for a fee waiver?</strong></h4>
            <p>Students who submit a lunch ticket application and qualify for the FREE or REDUCED lunch program also qualify for two SAT fee waivers in 11th grade and 12th grade. If you think your family may qualify for SAT fee waivers, please see Mr. Mendoza, your college counselor to determine if you are eligible to receive fee waivers. There is a limited amount. First come, first serve.</p>
